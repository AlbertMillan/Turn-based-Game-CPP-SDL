# Description

A single-level, single-player turn-based game. There are three characters controlled by the user, and three enemy zombie characters controlled by the AI. The goal is to get the user characters to kill the zombies before they the zombies kill them. To do so, the user characters can perform an action on every turn, including 'attack' and 'block'. The actions are shown in a menu at the bottom right of the screen. Each character has a set of predefined attributes (attack damage, speed, health, etc.) that determine the damage they do when attacking, the frequency at which they get to attack a zombie, and their hitpoints respectively. Once a character runs out of health, it does not get to attack anymore.

Notes:
- Game can be paused at any moment pressing 'P' from the keyboard.
